Unfortunately, I'm a programmer, not a lawyer: I don't know which license I am permitted to use and I don't want any kind of legal issue - it's not worth the risk.


So, if - and only if - I'm legally allowed (by the licenses of the libraries used in this project or any other limitation unknown to me): 
  Sniper-Bot is provided under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0).

Am I not permitted to distribute Sniper-Bot under this license?
  Good, as alternative I choose Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0).
  
 Still not permitted?
  I choose  as next alternative Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0).
  
 Still not?
  Okay, that's good,  as last alternative I choose GNU Lesser General Public License v3 (LGPL-3.0)
  
  
 If none of them is permitted, well, then consider it lincense-free: do whatever you want with this project, according to the licenses of the libraries that I use:
 it is your responsability to understand all the copyrights limitations behind and I am not hold liable of anything
 
            Did you choode the wrong license? Your fault.
            Did I choose the wrong license? I already explained all the mutual-exclusive choiches and the license-free last alternative in case of incomaptibility.
 
 HOWEVER I do reserve to me the possibility to later consult a lawyer and choose a definitive license among that list (following the provided order of priority). For now,
 it is your responsability to understand which is applicable (always following the provided order of priority).
 

I don't even know if such kind of "conditional license" is permitted or even legal - in case it is not, well, consider all the text above as a joke ( :D ) and Sniper-Bot
as license free.

Lastly, can't I distribute it license-free? I'm done: just tell me and I close the repository/remove everything/choose and appropriate license/I don't know.

Basically, I don't want any kind of legal issue, so I am not hold liable of anything and if you think that I'm breaking some kind of law / copyright just tell me 
peacefully, I'll remove everything and everybody will be happy!
